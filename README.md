# awesome-nostr

"nostr" stands for "**N**otes and **O**ther **S**tuff **T**ransmitted by
**R**elays" and is an open protocol for censorship-resistant global networks
created by [@fiatjaf](https://github.com/fiatjaf).

## Protocol

- [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) - overview and FAQ
- [NIPs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) - the "**N**ostr **I**mplementation **P**ossibilities" describe the protocol in technical detail
- [nostr, a basic tour](https://github.com/rajarshimaitra/rust-nostr/blob/main/VISION.md) - an intro to nostr
- [Nostr: Solucionando la censura de una vez por todas](https://estudiobitcoin.com/nostr-solucionando-la-censura-de-una-vez-por-todas/)
- [UseNostr](https://usenostr.org) - A small guide for anyone who wants to learn more about how nostr works and what it can do.

of the public instances.
